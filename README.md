## Overview

### CrowStike
You'll find CrowdStrikeDetectionMispImporter which is a Python script designed to integrate CrowdStrike's detection capabilities with MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform & Threat Sharing). The script fetches detection data from CrowdStrike, processes it, and creates corresponding events in MISP. This allows for efficient and automated sharing of threat intelligence between CrowdStrike and MISP.
